# record-me-principal memory

## Phase 1 baseline

- Severity tiers: CRITICAL (blocks merge), MAJOR (blocks unless explicitly
  waived), MINOR (post-merge follow-up).
- Always invoke `/codex:review` first (if available) — your Opus pass
  complements, doesn't duplicate.
- Plateau rule: 2 rounds with zero CRITICAL+MAJOR cleared → escalate.
